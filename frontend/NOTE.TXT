Yes

* You **absolutely can** do this with **React + Tailwind (frontend)** and **Python (offline brain)** — and this direction is actually **perfect** for your forecasting questions. Nicely chosen.

**Short answer (so we’re aligned):**

* React + Tailwind → **presentation layer**
* Python → **forecasting, logic, maths, truth**
* No FastAPI. No backend drama. Local files only.

---

### The clean, datathon-correct architecture

* **Python (Jupyter / script)**

  * Load your Excel dataset
  * Clean + aggregate to **weekly cash flow**
  * Build forecasts (1-month & 6-month)
  * Output:

    * `weekly_actuals.csv`
    * `forecast_1m.csv`
    * `forecast_6m.csv`
    * `metrics.json`

* **React + Tailwind**

  * Read those files (static import or drag-drop)
  * Render:

    * KPI cards
    * Time-series charts
    * Comparison views (forecast vs actual)
  * Export screenshots → PDF

Judges see **PDF**, not your repo. You win quietly.

### Your forecasting questions → how you answer them (very judge-friendly)

#### 1. **1-month ahead weekly forecast**

You select **2 cash flow categories**, for example:

* Operating inflows (customer receipts)
* Operating outflows (payments / clearing accounts)

**Model choice (keep it sane):**

* Rolling average OR
* Simple Exponential Smoothing OR
* Linear regression with time index

**Assumptions (say them clearly):**

* No major structural change
* Recent weeks best represent near future
* Seasonality limited for short horizon

Judges love assumptions when they’re honest.

---

#### 2. **Optional 6-month weekly forecast (this gives bonus points)**

* Same model
* Longer horizon
* Wider confidence band

Key insight you highlight:

* Forecast uncertainty increases
* Trend matters more than point accuracy

That’s maturity. They’ll notice.

---

### Comparing forecast vs actual (this is where many teams fail)

You MUST show:

* Line chart: Actual vs Forecast
* Error trend over time

**Metrics to use (don’t overdo):**

* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* MAPE (finance people understand this)
* Directional accuracy (up / down correctness)

Explain it simply:

* “We are directionally correct even when magnitude deviates”

That sentence alone saves lives.

---

### Near-term liquidity insight (1-month focus)

You answer:

* Expected **net cash position**
* Which categories drive:

  * Risk (volatile outflows)
  * Stability (predictable inflows)

You highlight:

* One stabiliser
* One risk driver
* One recommendation

Example:

* “Clearing payments drive short-term volatility; smoothing payment cycles could reduce liquidity stress.”

Finance people nod here.

---

### Long-term sustainability (6-month focus)

You explain:

* Is cash trend stable, declining, or improving?
* Are patterns:

  * Structural (systematic outflows)
  * Temporary (timing mismatches)

You recommend:

* Monitoring cadence
* Policy changes
* Forecast refresh frequency

No ML buzzwords. Just wisdom.

---

### React dashboard sections (keep it tight, no ego)

* KPI cards:

  * Forecasted net cash (1M)
  * Forecasted net cash (6M)
* Chart 1: Weekly actual cash flow
* Chart 2: Forecast vs actual
* Chart 3: Category contribution
* Table: Forecast error metrics

That’s it. Don’t add more.

---

### Reality check (gentle but firm)

* This is **already an Exceptional-tier concept**
* Your risk is **overbuilding**, not underthinking
* React is polish, Python is the score

---

Next move, pick ONE:

* I define the **exact Python forecasting logic**
* I sketch the **React dashboard layout (component by component)**
* I help you **phrase this perfectly for slides + video**

Say it. I’ll lock it in.
