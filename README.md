PROBLEM STATEMENT & SOLUTION OVERVIEW
================================================================================

## PHASE 1: PROBLEM STATEMENT

Modern finance teams face increasing difficulty in managing liquidity and cash
sustainability due to the complexity and fragmentation of transactional data.

Although organisations collect detailed cash balance and transaction records,
these datasets are often used only for retrospective reporting. They do not
provide sufficient forward-looking insight to support timely decision-making.

Key problems identified:

1. Limited ability to anticipate short-term cash shortages before they occur.
2. Poor visibility into whether cash volatility is temporary or structural.
3. Lack of an integrated executive view that connects forecasts, risks, and
   operational drivers into a single narrative.

As a result, finance leaders are often forced to react to liquidity stress
instead of proactively managing it.

The objective of this project is to transform raw cash data into an intelligent
decision-support system that explains:

- What is happening now
- What is likely to happen next
- Where the underlying risks originate

================================================================================
PHASE 2: SOLUTION DESIGN & DATA UTILISATION
================================================================================

This solution is built using data from:

- Data - Cash Balance
- Data - Main
  (from datathon_dataset.xlsx)

Each page addresses a specific financial question and produces actionable
insights.

---

1. OVERVIEW DASHBOARD

---

Data Used:

- Data - Cash Balance (starting liquidity)
- Data - Main (weekly transaction aggregation)

What It Generates:

- Weekly net cash flow
- Rolling cash position

Why It Matters:

1. Establishes a clear baseline view of liquidity health
2. Enables rapid executive-level assessment
3. Acts as the foundation for all downstream analysis

---

2. CASH FORECAST PAGE

---

Data Used:

- Historical weekly cash flows derived from Data - Main

What It Generates:

- 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month cash flow forecasts

Why It Matters:

1. Supports short-term and medium-term liquidity planning
2. Enables proactive cash management instead of reactive actions
3. Helps finance teams prepare for upcoming funding gaps or surpluses

---

3. LIQUIDITY RISK PAGE

---

Data Used:

- Weekly net cash flow
- Rolling volatility metrics
- Stress scores and stability index

What It Generates:

- Volatility shock detection
- Liquidity stress indicators
- Stability classification (Low / Medium / High risk)

Why It Matters:

1. Identifies abnormal cash behaviour early
2. Converts raw volatility into interpretable risk signals
3. Provides early warning indicators for potential liquidity crises

---

4. CASH STRUCTURE PAGE

---

Data Used:

- Directional transaction patterns (inflow vs outflow)

What It Generates:

- Inflow vs outflow dependency analysis
- Transaction concentration metrics
- Structural dependency trends

Why It Matters:

1. Reveals whether cash health depends heavily on one direction
2. Highlights structural weaknesses masked by aggregate totals
3. Helps leadership understand long-term sustainability risks

---

5. EXECUTIVE REPORT

---

Data Used:

- All derived outputs from previous pages

What It Generates:

- Consolidated financial narrative
- PDF-ready executive summary

Why It Matters:

1. Translates technical analysis into strategic insight
2. Enables clear communication with non-technical stakeholders
3. Supports faster, better-informed executive decisions
